As EcuTek Tuners we are mostly concerned with controlling the use of the Port Injectors.\nOur current understanding maps out to have the following in normal operating modes it uses\nthe Operation Point (OPP) to select a standard combustion mode slot (there are 49 slots total, 0-48),\nthen a translation of the slot to a defined combustion mode is performed (there are 39 modes total 0-38),\nthe priorities and inhibits applied to each combustion mode then applied.\nFall back combustion and transition modes etc are applied if he mode targeted can't be achieved\nAfter which the inhibit disables are applied and the final combustion mode target is decided.\nthe maps are defined in the Combustion Mode Manager Tree\nFactory Behavior\nSimos 18.1 EU6c have 39 combustion modes (CMB) that are available during different operating modes of the engine performance envelope.\nTo further understand what CMB modes are seen during normal running, a drive of a development vehicle was captured from a cold start to various loads monitoring ?Present CMB Mode?.\n27 (Cold start - 3 high pressure stratified (S) until 45 deg C coolant) -> 16 (Cat heating for more than a minute secs suction direct injection(SDI) and S) -> 0 (SDI at light loads until 45 deg C) -> 2 (SDI + S till 4000 rpm high load -> 0 (SDI at high load).\nWarms starts were observed to be 26 (two high pressure stratified), followed by no cat heating or warming after, if the engine coolant temp was greater than 45 deg C. During periods of acceleration from sub 2000 rpm with the turbo spooling, engine can enter into a scavenging mode 4 or 6\nThis is shown in the Ecutek EU6c calibration for MPI supplementary operation, leaves all light load CMB functions, cat heating and starting the same as OE, but from ~90 Nm, replaces mode 2 and 0 with a new mode 9 i.e. MPI + SDI.\nCombustion Mode descriptions\nthe list of
